# Katas

I'm [publicly learning](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) new programming languages (or practising the ones I was already familiar with) using Test-Driven Development.

This repository holds a small collection of code katas in the following languages:

* [Elm](tree/master/elm)
* [Go](tree/master/golang)
* [Kotlin](tree/master/kotlin)
* [ReasonML](tree/master/reasonml)
* [Rust](tree/master/rust)
* [TypeScript](tree/master/typescript)

It's also a handy repository where I can fetch a basic project scaffold with unit test support without having to waste time with configuration.
